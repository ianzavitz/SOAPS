# SOAPS
## Scientist's Open-Source Assembly Pipeline Suite 

SOAPS is designed as a command line tool, but the intention is to implement a gui to make it more accessible to bench scientists. 

It is a python wrapper, which runs up to three assemblers(SPAdes, IDBA and megahit) on input data. Upon completion of the assemblies, SOAPS parses output to generate a report of key statistics for each assembly. 

SOAPS was created to work much like PATRIC (patricbrc.org), but with more of the assembler arguments in the hands of the user.
