# SOAPS
## Scientist's Open-Source Assembly Pipeline Suite 

Inteded to accomodate users with minimal 'tech-literacy' as well as users well-versed in bioinformatics tools, SOAPS contains a number of assemblers (SPAdes, IDBA, Megahit). 

SOAPS is designed as a command line tool, but I intend to implement a gui to make it more accessible to bench scientists.
